- Replay Bot Scoreboard names NOT changing when setting new recs

+ Re-add the MySQL queries in code and make it switch between API and DB functions
- Map Time is NOT being saved with API
- Make configs generate themselves inside the `./configs/plugins/...` folder
- Fix loading MapTimes for each type (stage, bonus, maps) 
  - API
  - DB
+ Change `DB_QUERY_MAP_GET_RUNS` query with `DB_QUERY_MAP_GET_RECORD_RUNS_AND_COUNT` in API and edit code in plugin
+ Change `DB_QUERY_PB_GET_RUNTIME` query in API

- Double check the Start/End velocities for End Zone,Checkpoints, Stages, Bonuses
  + Maps
  + Checkpoints
  - Stages
    - Try and get the Start/End velocity values from the Checkpoint object in Map Run
  + Bonuses

- Using `!spec` from any start zone and going back to CT starts your timer - Will be in a PR 

- Try and determine Left/Right side for Bonuses (surf_ace)
- Try and determine Left/Right side for Maps
- Try and determine Left/Right side for Stages
# Done
+ Hibernation fucks up the creation of `CurrentMap`, if nobody has joined the first map it was on and you change to another map, server segfaults. I guess a query is being held?? :think:
  + Solution is to use `Server.NextWorldUpdate` as hibernation stops all `Timer`s :peepoHappy:
+ Introduce `async` for queries and some methods
+ Make Database spawn a new connection for each query to avoid `Connection in use` error
  + Add notes to apply `using` blocks for certain methods for proper operation
+ Move **PlayerProfile** queries to the respective class
+ Move **Map** queries to the respective class
+ Total Completions for a map are wrong in HUD
+ Add `Situation` to each `ReplayFrame` and load it properly
  + Fix `STAGE_EXIT_ZONE` situations - not triggered (logic in `TriggerEndTouch` is most likely bad)
+ Fix Map Replays
  + Reload after setting a new WR
  + Load if no replay existed before a new run
  + Use the `ReplayFrameSituation` for determining where to cut replays
  + Do not cut replay as soon as we enter end zone (determined by the AddTimer amount for `SaveMapTime`)
+ Double check the Checkpoints comparison messages
  + 1st run: [CS2 Surf] CP [1]: 02.468 (1083) [PB: N/A (N/A) | WR: N/A (N/A)]
  + 2nd run: [CS2 Surf] CP [1]: 02.421 (1128) [PB: +02.390 (+46) | WR: +02.390 (+46)]
+ Fix Stage replays
  + Track the times even during Map Run on staged maps
  + Include the pre-strafe
  + Load all of them instead of overwriting and cycle (maybe make StageWR a Dictionary)
  + Reload them after setting a new Stage WR 
  + Load if no replay existed before
  + Use the `ReplayFrameSituation` for determining where to cut replays
  + Save stage replays when `IsStageMode` is enabled
    + Use seperate method
  + Save the correct amount of `Ticks` for stage runs during map run
    + Use seperate method
  + Save the last stage time - triggered in `END_ZONE_ENTER`
    + `IsStageMode`
      + Use seperate method
    + Map run
      + Use seperate method
  + When loading new stage replays the cycling of them does not work
+ First ever map run does not save Checkpoints, check if we wait to retrieve the MapTime_ID before trying to insert Checkpoints
+ Trim different type of replays based on situations
  + Map Replays
  + Stage Replays during Map runs
  + Stage Replays in `IsStageMode`
  + Bonus Replays
+ Replay bots are not being spawned on `Linear` maps
  + Needs the CS2Fixes NAV mesh patch to work with our implementation
